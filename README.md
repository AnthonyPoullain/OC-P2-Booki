## üéØ Goals of this project

Integrate a fully responsive web page for the home page of BOOKI, a hotel & tourist activities booking app, following the [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/r9YJyUkpVdrxzBBKGH7reY/Maquettes-Booki-(desktop%2C-mobile%2C-tablette)?node-id=3%3A0&t=aSSTnHDTI9f1lLka-0) & using plain HTML & CSS.

### What was required

- Integrate mobile first application design from [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/r9YJyUkpVdrxzBBKGH7reY/Maquettes-Booki-(desktop%2C-mobile%2C-tablette)?node-id=3%3A0&t=aSSTnHDTI9f1lLka-0)
- 100% pixel accuracy
- Use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons

### What was considered for better DX

- Seperate & organize CSS stylesheets by screen width & responsibility
- Use the [BEM](https://getbem.com/) convention for better naming
